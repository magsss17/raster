(** Pixel Module

    The [Pixel] module provides a representation and utility functions for
    working with RGB-color pixels. Each pixel is represented as a tuple of
    three integer values, one each for the red, green, and blue (RGB)
    channels. *)

(** [t] is a tuple of three integers, representing the red, green, and blue
    channels of an RGB color pixel. *)
type t = int * int * int [@@deriving sexp]

(** [red t] returns the value of the red channel of the pixel [t]. *)
val red : t -> int

(** [green t] returns the value of the green channel of the pixel [t]. *)
val green : t -> int

(** [blue t] returns the value of the blue channel of the pixel [t]. *)
val blue : t -> int

(** [zero] is a constant representing a black pixel. It is equivalent to the
    pixel value [(0, 0, 0)]. *)
val zero : t

(** [p1 + p2] returns a new pixel value formed by component-wise addition of
    [p1] and [p2]. *)
val ( + ) : t -> t -> t

(** [of_int x] returns an equivalent pixel value, where each channel has the
    same integer value [x]. This function is most useful when working with
    grayscale colors. *)
val of_int : int -> t

(** [to_string t] returns a string representation of the pixel [t] in the
    format "R G B", where R, G, and B are the integer values of the red,
    green, and blue channels, respectively. *)
val to_string : t -> string

val create : int -> int -> int -> t
